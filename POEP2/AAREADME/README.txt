There 2 options in the navigation bar, Products and add Farmer(/User). I had a third just basic Home Page up until the morning of submission and 
it looked super nice but then for some reason it broke my whole project and I had to remove it. Trust me I really tried to debug it.

If you Select Products, you will be able to see all the products that are available in the system. You can also add a new product by clicking on the Add Product button.
If you are a Farmer, you can only check your own products and you can add a new product. You can also filter by date.
If you are an Admin, you can see all the products by all the farmers and you can also filter by date or user or both.
It is Scrollalble which is nice.

If you select Add Farmer(User), you can add a new user to the system with a Username and password. However, this is only available to the Admin.
You can select if you want to add a farmer or employee on this screen as well for further testing.
